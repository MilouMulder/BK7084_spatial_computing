This script prepares a data list for the use in Grasshopper via Rhino.Inside Revit. Similarly to [Notebook 4 - solar outside](/a4.2_Notebook4/), a neighbour check is done to check for facades and roofs/floors. On the other hand, different from Notebook 4 is the way the result is saved. This script establishes a data structure in which the direction of facades are separately saved. This is later used to place facades on the proper voxel faces.

```Python
#load the complete lattice

#Create a coordinates list
for each voxel in complete lattice
    establish coordintes as [x, y, z]

#Find neighbouring voxels
facade list = []
floor/roof list = []
#Data structure = [x, y, z, [North, East, South, West](facades), [Top, Bottom](roof/floor)]
for each coordinate
    for direction x,y (-1, +1)
        check if [x, y, z] are not in coordinates
        if True
            #facade here
            append a one to the appropriate index in facade list
    for direction z (-1, +1)
        check if [x, y, z] are not in coordinates
        if True
            #floor/roof here
            append a one to the appropriate index in roof/floor list
    Establish result list as [x, y, z, [facades], [roof/floor]]

#Export data
Export result list as 'facade_3_6.txt'    
```
