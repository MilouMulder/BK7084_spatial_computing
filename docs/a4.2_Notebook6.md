The following script will load the previously stored [sound data](/a4.2_Notebook5/) files and scale them so they for a proper sound lattice.
First, the script iterates over the different files in data/sound and adds those to a list. Then a scalar is established and the whole list is stored, reshaped and exported into a CSV.

```Python
#Load the complete lattice
create a base list of zeroes in same shape as complete lattice

for each sound file in 'data/sound'
    Unpickle and save to sound list

#Use the sound list with [x, y, z, val] to make a sound lattice with only val
for each voxel in sound list
    base list[x, y, z] = sound value

#Scalar so max = 1.0 and min = 0.0
scalar = max - min

#Scaling the sound value
for each voxel in base list
    if val != 0
        val -= min
        val /= scalar

#Export sound lattice
Export sound lattice to 'sound_3_6.csv'
```
