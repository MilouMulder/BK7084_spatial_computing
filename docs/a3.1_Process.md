#Sun analysis (year basis)
Before running the Solar Envelope we researched how the surrounding buildings cast a shadow on the current site throughout the year. Here for the analysis ran every 15th day of the month at 12:00 oâ€™clock. This research shows us that if we would not increase the height of the building, it will only cast a shadow on the lower part of the building across the street (northeast) in the winter months.
