The following script is used to edit the solar access lattice to have values based on the number of facades each voxel has. First, a check for neighbours is done for each voxel. Where no neighbour is found a facade is needed. 
After this step, we remove any facades counted for voxels with z=0 that found facades where the ground is expected.
Then the solar access values are scaled by the facade count and the new data is exported as a CSV.

```Python
#Load the complete lattice and complete solar access

#Initialize a coordinates list
for each voxel
    add [x, y, z] to coordinates

#Find neighbouring voxels
base result = 6 (faces)
for each coordinate
    for each direction (x, y, z)(-1, +1)
        check if [x, y, z] are in coordinates
        if True
            #no facade here
            result -= 1
    Establish result list as [x, y, z, result]

#Disregarding the ground as a facade
for each voxel in result list
    if z == 0
        #remove earlier found ground facade
        result -= 1
    #scale result so max = 1.0
    result /= 6

#Scaling the solar access list
for each voxel in result list 
    solar access value at [x, y, z] *= val

#Export the solar access lattice
Export solar acces to 'solar_access_outside_3_6.csv'
```
