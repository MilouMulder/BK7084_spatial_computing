##Bubble diagram
The bubble diagram in *[Figure X](img\1\1_Bubble-Diagram.png)* consists of four types of spaces: housing, centre, facilities and recreation. While the centre for public visitors is the atrium, in which all public spaces eventually lead to, the centre for the residents is the courtyard, this is where all the spaces that are only meant for residents are connected to. During the making of the bubble diagram, noise pollution is taken into account. The spaces that have been put on the left produce noise pollution and on the right side are noise sensitive functions. Furthermore, for the placement of the entrances the visuality, accessibility, and convenience have been considered.

##Metronetwork
The Metro network in *[Figure X](img\1\1_Metronetwork.png)* shows examples of the movement through the building of various residents. This graph gives us a first observation of how the connections in our bubble diagram could be used.

##Resident stories
To test and optimise the metronetwork, we made up six imaginary stories to represent the future residents: two students, two starters and two elderly. In *[Figure X](img\1\1_resident_stories.jpg)* a day in the life of each resident is pictured.

##Matrix
The [matrix (problem)](<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTXQ7xN6Oc80H7ovOIW-T_XuTy-P3YVa4lM9-Nyhjp6YincE2vTo0UpYqls-JCI2A/pubhtml?gid=714829719&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false"></iframe>) shows different kinds of abstract information which later will be used in the spatial computation of our site. The first part represents the connection between the different functions. As you can see, the matrix is not mirrored, this is due to a different kind of importance between the voxels. For example, is the connection between assisted living and starter housing more important (because the starters could help the residents of the assisted livings with small things) than the connection between starter housing and assisted living.
In addition to the accessibility between the voxels, we added factors of graph-distance (like accessibility to the entrances and greenery), factors belonging to the euclidean-distance (silent level and noise sensitivity), and elements which can be categorized as ‘visibility’ such as daylight, direct sunlight and view.

##Flowchart (summary)

The flowchart as shown in *[Figure X](img\1\1_Flowchart_version_2.png)* represents a visualisation of all the important steps that are made within the Notebooks. On the corresponding pages, where the notebooks are explained, the section of the flowchart that is used, is shown once again.
