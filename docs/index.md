# Spatial Computing Project Template

> This is a project template for Spatial Computing Students. Students shall fork this repository and use it as the basis of their project. Mid-term and Final submission is expected through pull GitHub.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This web portal is the result of the course [BK7083](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk/studeren/minoren-en-keuzevakken/spatial-computing-in-architectural-design/) "Computational Design Studio" given in the minor program Spatial Computing in Architectural Design at the Technical University of Delft. During this minor, we have formulated a programme of requirements and subsequently used mathematical spatial computing constructs to design and simulate the optimum building. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assignment of this course consists of a computational design for the site in the area of the Rotterdamse Maakkwartier. Currently, this building (also known as ZOHO) is used for residency, workshops, studios and startups. This is why the ZOHO is promoted with the following: 
>For and by makers in design, art, culture, media, tech, food, architecture and urban planning. All pioneers who want to use their craftsmanship to strengthen themselves, ZOHO, and the city in an innovative way. (Stichting ZOHOCITIZENS Ondernemerscollectief, 2018)

The aim of this project is to design a new building that fits into the requirements given by the tutors, the (imaginary) future residents and ourselves, using diverse python scripts. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The structure of this webpage is based on the assignments of the weeks, where each week has its own folder. These folders are divided into two extra folders: ‘Process’ and ‘Products’. In the folders ‘Process’ the research, which was needed for the final products and conclusions, is documented. The conclusions can therefore be found in the folder ‘Products’.
