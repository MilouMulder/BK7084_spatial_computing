# Spatial Computing Project Template

> This is a project template for Spatial Computing Students. Students shall fork this repository and use it as the basis of their project. Mid-term and Final submission is expected through pull GitHub.

This web portal is the result of the course BK7083 ‘’Computational Design Studio’’ given in the minor program Spatial Computing in Architectural Design at the Technical University of Delft. During this minor, we have formulated a program of requirements and subsequently used mathematical spatial computing constructs to design and simulate the optimum building. 

The structure of this webpage is based on the assignments of the weeks, where each week has its own folder. These folders are divided into two extra folders: ‘Process’ and ‘Products’. In the folders ‘Process’ the research, which was needed for the final products and conclusions, is documented. The conclusions can therefore be found in the folder ‘Products’.
