##Design philosophy
###Design goals
The given Design goals are separated into two categories: quantitative and qualitative (see *Figure X*). Additional we formulated three more design goals which have priority:

* Optimise the building for Sunlight and Sound Pollution
* Develop a layout that suits the residents
* Create a pleasant Living Environment

##Analysis on the Site

###Building visualisation

The visualization of the surrounding environment of our site (*Figure X*) consists of a scale of architectural styles. This is due to the different building years, which have led to a diverse neighbourhood where different facades are positioned next to each other. The functions of the buildings also play a role in the diverse visualization. The main function is dwelling but there are also businesses and offices situated. Furthermore, our site is in ZOHO, which is the name of the area of the Rotterdamse Maakkwartier. A developing working and living space for and by makers in design, art, culture, media, tech, food architecture and urban planning. All pioneers who want to use their craftsmanship to strengthen themselves and ZOHO. This is reflected in the appearance of the environment. Creative and notable graphs can be found on the walls, which gives the area a coming up and hip neighbourhood feel. Moreover, near the site there is a shared garden and sportsfield for residents to use and where they can meet others.
After analyzing the environment it is clear that the current building (*Figure X*) blends right in the area. Different kinds of functions that cause multiple identities. The building is a combination of a variation of heights and both monotone and trendy patterned facades.

###Access routes
In *Figure X* the accessibility of our site is shown. Our site is directly surrounded by a sidewalk with a few thresholds for access to the parking garage. Only the northeast side of the building is more focused on the accessibility for cars, because of the direct street that is situated opposite the building. Near the building, there are some car parking and a few bicycle parking. Furthermore, the main roads for vehicles that surround our site are bicycle roads (a bicycle road where cars are the guests and cyclists have the priority) and ‘normal’ car roads. In *Figure X* it is visualized which car roads are busy and which are widely used. In addition to this, the green walking route that is close to our site is shown.

###Building heights in the environment
If you look at the built environment, as shown in *Figure X*, and start in the north/ northeast, you can see that these buildings are mainly between 18 and 23 meters high. Most of these buildings are terraced houses. If you go around the map clockwise, the buildings are getting higher. Here we still have residents' buildings, but now shaped as duplex houses. At the bottom of the map (south), we are getting closer to the center of Rotterdam. This is why the buildings in the Southwest are higher than the buildings in the north: These are mainly office buildings with a height between 40 meters or even higher than 100 meters. To finish the clock, in the West, same as in the Southeast, we can find duplex houses. Nevertheless, these buildings have more storeys.
With a height of 22 meters, our site currently fits in the street scene very well due to the similar building heights. But if the future building is higher than 40 meters, it will become more of a landmark..

##Program of requirements
###Functions
In *Figure X*, a table is shown where aspects concerning the sizes of all the spaces can be found. Which are the floor height, on which storey, square meter, amount of rooms, amount of voxels and for how many people the space is designed. This information will be used to construct the building in spatial computing.

###Noise table
The average assigned noise level per space can be seen in *Figure X*. As well as the hours in which the noise levels occur. The corresponding reason for the chosen time in which the noise levels score a middle to high level has also been added. Besides, the spaces that are noise sensitive have also been classified.

####Noise chart
The previous table showed us the average noise level and sensitivity of the various rooms. To have a better impression when the functions reach the different noise levels in specific moments of the day, the following noise-diagram is made. This gives us a good overview of which functions can be located next to each other, and which ones have to be separated by a greater distance.
