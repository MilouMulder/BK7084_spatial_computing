##Voxel size - decision making

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the optimal voxel size, we considered the sizes 1.5 and 1.8 due to the common use of multiples of these numbers within building constructions. To set a limit, we mainly looked at how these voxel sizes would fit into a staircase. Therefore, we investigated two types of staircases: a straight stair and a landing stair. The information we rely on is shown in the following [*Figure X* (problem)](... .

| Stair No. | Voxelsize | Staircase type | Voxels in x, y, z | meters in x, y, z | Steps | Height of step | Angle of staircase |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Stair 1 | 1.8 | Straight | 1, 2, 2 | 1.8, 3.6, 3.6 | 18 | 0.2 | 45° |
| Stair 2 | 1.5 | Straight | 1, 2, 2 | 1.5, 3.0, 3.0 | 15 | 0.2 | 45° |
| **Stair 3** | **1.8** | **Landing** | **1, 2, 2** | **1.8, 3.6, 3.6** | **20** | **0.18** | **31°** |
| Stair 4 | 1.5 | Landing | 1, 2, 2 | 1.5, 3.0, 3.0 | 17 | 0.2 | 32.1° |
| **Stair 5** | **1.8** | **Straight** | **1, 3, 2** | **1.8, 5.4, 3.6** | **20** | **0.18** | **33.7°** |
| Stair 6 | 1.5 | Straight | 1, 3, 2 | 1.5, 4.5, 3.0 | 17 | 0.176 | 33.7° |
| Stair 7 | 1.8 | Landing | 1, 3, 2 | 1.8, 5.4, 3.6 | 24 | 0.15 | 23.4° |
| Stair 8 | 1.5 | Landing | 1, 3, 2 | 1.5, 4.5, 3.0 | 20 | 0.15 | 23.7° |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concluding, we can see that Stair 3 and Stair 5 (both stairs within the 1.8 grid) are the optimal stairs within the voxel sizes 1.5 and 1.8. Stair 3 fits into a voxel grid of one voxel in the x-direction (1.8 m), two voxels in the y-direction (2 * 1.8 m = 3.6 m) and two voxels in the z-direction (2 * 1.8 m = 3.6 m). Stair 5 fits in a voxel grid of one voxel in the x-direction (1.8 m), three voxels in the y-direction (3 * 1.8 m = 5.4 m) and two voxels in the z-direction (2 * 1.8 m + 3.6 m). For both of these stairs, the amount of steps fits into 1.8 * 10 plus a micro voxel of 2 and the height of the steps also fits within the 18 centimeters. The visualisation of the stairs is shown in [*Figure X*](img\2\2_stairs.jpg).

It represents a visualisation of all the important steps that are made to create our voxelated model within the Notebook  *[w1 - voxelization(problem)](link)*. The python code will be explained in detail on the next [page](a2.1_Product.md).
