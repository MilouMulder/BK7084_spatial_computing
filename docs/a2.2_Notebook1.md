The following script will voxelize a given mesh. In regards to our project, we provide the script with a mesh of what we consider to be an acceptable maximum envelope for the context. Then the size of the voxels is provided. As mentioned in [Voxel size - decision making](/a2.1_Process/#voxel-size-decision-making) we chose voxel sizes that are multiplications of 3.6. Our biggest chosen voxel size is 14.4, which is used to initially voxelize the envelope mesh. This collection of voxels is then saved in a three-dimensional lattice and exported.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowchart as shown in *[Figure X](link)* is the **first section**(problem) of the bigger [flowchart](img\1\1_Flowchart_version_2.png) as shown in the [*Planning - products*](/a1.1_Product/#flowchart-summary). It represents a visualisation of all the important steps that are made to create our voxelated model in Notebook 1 **[voxelization(problem)](..\notebooks\01_voxelization.ipynb)**. The python code will be explained in detail later on in the a [pseudo code](/a2.2_Notebook1/#pseudo-code).

## Pseudo code 
>add text with link to notebook

``` python
Initialize large voxel size (14.4)
Load "envelope.stl"
Check if mesh is watertight
Visualize mesh
Forego the check for inside to use boundaries instead of mesh
  Create full_lattice conisiting of only 'True'
Reshape full_lattice to properly
create a tg lattice from full_lattice
export full_lattice to lattice_14_4.csv
```
