This is due to the different building years, which have led to a diverse neighbourhood where different facades are positioned next to each other. The functions of the buildings also play a role in the diverse visualization. The main function is dwelling but there are also businesses and offices situated. Furthermore, our site is in ZOHO, which is the name of the area of the Rotterdamse Maakkwartier.

All pioneers who want to use their craftsmanship to strengthen themselves and ZOHO. This is reflected in the appearance of the environment. Creative and notable graphs can be found on the walls, which gives the area a coming up and hip neighbourhood feel. Moreover, near the site there is a shared garden and sportsfield for residents to use and where they can meet others. After analyzing the environment it is clear that the current building ( Figure X ) blends right in the area. Different kinds of functions that cause multiple identities. The building is a combination of a variation of heights and both monotone and trendy patterned facades. Access routes In Figure X the accessibility of our site is shown. Our site is directly surrounded by a sidewalk with a few thresholds for access to the parking garage. Only the northeast side of the building is more focused on the accessibility for cars, because of the direct street that is situated opposite the building. Near the building, there are some car parking and a few bicycle parking. Furthermore, the main roads for vehicles that surround our site are bicycle roads (a bicycle road where cars are the guests and cyclists have the priority) and \u2018normal\u2019 car roads. In Figure X it is visualized which car roads are busy and which are widely used. In addition to this, the green walking route that is close to our site is shown. Building heights in the environment If you look at the built environment, as shown in Figure X , and start in the north/ northeast, you can see that these buildings are mainly between 18 and 23 meters high. Most of these buildings are terraced houses. If you go around the map clockwise, the buildings are getting higher. Here we still have residents' buildings, but now shaped as duplex houses. At the bottom of the map (south), we are getting closer to the center of Rotterdam. This is why the buildings in the Southwest are higher than the buildings in the north: These are mainly office buildings with a height between 40 meters or even higher than 100 meters. To finish the clock, in the West, same as in the Southeast, we can find duplex houses. Nevertheless, these buildings have more storeys. With a height of 22 meters, our site currently fits in the street scene very well due to the similar building heights. But if the future building is higher than 40 meters, it will become more of a landmark.. Programme of requirements Functions In Figure X , a table is shown where aspects concerning the sizes of all the spaces can be found. Which are the floor height, on which storey, square meter, amount of rooms, amount of voxels and for how many people the space is designed. This information will be used to construct the building in spatial computing. [table_rooms] Noise table The average assigned noise level per space can be seen in Figure X . As well as the hours in which the noise levels occur. The corresponding reason for the chosen time in which the noise levels score a middle to high level has also been added. Besides, the spaces that are noise sensitive have also been classified. [table_noise] Noise chart The previous table showed us the average noise level and sensitivity of the various rooms.

Create documentation environment Now we need to create the appropriate environment for documenting by installing all the necessary tools. To do so we have provided you an environment droplet, which is a recipe for a series of installations that create the aforementioned environment. For that, after directing to the root folder of this project where the environment droplet ( environment.yml ) is located, you need to run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml Start Work on Documentation After finishing your work on documentation you need to shutdown the server and deactivate the environment. Activate the Environment Now that you have created the appropriate environment, you need to activate the environment to be able to work inside it. For that, as you are in the root folder of this project, you need to run the following command: conda activate spatial_computing_docs If the command line is now indicating the name of the environment in paranthesis, it means that the environment is activated. Similar to this ( spatial_computing_docs ) { your username } @ { your computer name } spatial_computing_project_template % Run the Local Server Now that the environment is activated, we need to run the local server to be able to see the result of changes in the local version of the documentation website. For that, run the following command: mkdocs serve After running this command, if the server has started to work successfully, you should see the following line in the command line: INFO - Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000 This means that the server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . If you open your browser and go this link you should see a local version of the site. Writing Your Documentation In the documenting process you need to head to the docs folder and edit the .md (markdown) files, since the website is build from these files. In the root of this project, you can edit the configurations of your project in mkdocs.yml file: Adding o removing pages Add markdown extensions . Some of the useful extensions: arithmatex for writing mathematics highlight for code highlighting Customizing the looks of your documentation Adding MkDocs Plugins , such as: mknotebooks for including python notebooks in the documentations Finish Work on Documentation Server Shut Down To shutdown the server, you need to press Ctrl + C in the command line. The following should appear in the command line: INFO - Shutting down... Deactivate Environment After shutting down your server the command line is back to the normal state and you can run commands again. To deactivate your environment you need to run the following command: conda deactivate Deployment of the Documentation Site Build and Deploy to deploy your documentation website, you need to run the following command in the root of this repository: mkdocs gh-deploy This command will create a new branch in your repository called gh-pages and build your site in it. It will then push the new branch to your remote repository automatically. It will also create a site folder in your root directory containing all of your site files. Since this folder is added .gitignore file, it won't be committed or pushed to the remote repository. Setup GitHub Pages For the first time, you need to configure the GitHub Pages service on your GitHub repository so it wil automatically build your documentation website whenever you deploy your site. To do this: Go to your repository setting, got GitHub Pages section, select gh-pages branch, select /(root) location, click on the save button.
